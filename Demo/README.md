# Network Topologies:

## Star Topology
In a star topology, each device is connected directly to a central hub or switch. 
The central device manages and controls all communications, acting as a mediator for data flow between devices. Advantages include easy management and fault isolation, but it relies heavily on the central hub's reliability.

## Bus Topology
A bus topology uses a single cable (the bus) to connect all devices in the network. 
Data is transmitted as electrical signals down the bus, and each device receives all transmissions but only processes those intended for it. It's simple and inexpensive but can suffer from collisions and is less scalable for large networks.

## Ring Topology
In a ring topology, devices are connected in a circular manner where each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a closed loop. 
Data travels in one direction around the ring, with each device receiving and forwarding data packets. It's efficient and predictable but can be disrupted if one device fails or the ring is broken.

Each topology has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different network environments based on factors like scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of maintenance.
